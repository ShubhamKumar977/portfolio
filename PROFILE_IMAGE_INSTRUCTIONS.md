# How to Add Your Profile Picture

## Quick Steps:

1. **Download your LinkedIn profile picture**:
   - Go to your LinkedIn profile
   - Right-click on your profile picture
   - Select "Save image as..."
   - Save it as `profile.jpg`

2. **Add to portfolio**:
   - Place the `profile.jpg` file in the root folder of your portfolio (same folder as index.html)

3. **Done!**
   - The image will automatically appear in the navbar
   - It will be circular with a nice border
   - Hover effect included

## Image Requirements:

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Recommended 200x200px or larger (will be resized to 45x45px)
- **Name**: Must be named `profile.jpg` (or update the filename in data.json)

## Alternative: Use a different image

If you want to use a different image name:
1. Save your image with any name (e.g., `shubham-photo.jpg`)
2. Open `data.json`
3. Change `"profileImage": "profile.jpg"` to `"profileImage": "your-image-name.jpg"`

## Temporary Solution:

Until you add your image, the navbar will show "SKG" as a fallback.
